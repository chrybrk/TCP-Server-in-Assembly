# TCP-Server-in-Assembly
TCP client server written in assembly.

# How to compile
`$ make -B` that is all you've to do to compile and run.

# Something to know
- It is very buggy, and i mean very... because i don't know shit about tch chat thing, or how to actually `read` and `write`, properly, so ig i'm gonna leave it like just that.
